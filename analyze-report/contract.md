# Interpretation contract

**Status: in force.** Every field below exists in `report_index.json` today.

The definitions behind every number in the report. An assistant answering from it uses
these and no others. The verdict rules have a code twin in `report/charts.py::verdict`;
the two change together.

## Fields, per arch/dtype/op/variant

| Field | Definition |
|---|---|
| `max_ulp` | worst defined ULP error: `\|y_ref − y\| / ULP(y_ref)`, reference in fp64, ULP by tt-metal's definition at the compute dtype |
| `mean_ulp` | mean over points with a defined, non-zero ULP. `—` means every point was exact |
| `usable_to` | largest \|x\| below which no point exceeds 2 ULP and none is a defect. Unary only; `—` elsewhere, where x alone does not determine the output |
| `max_abs` | worst absolute error |
| `ulp_clipped` | points past the chart clamp of 1000 ULP |
| `n_inputs` | measured points. An fp32 row is the worst point of 2¹⁶ consecutive codes |
| `outcomes` | count per label, below |
| `specials` | device vs golden at ±0, ±inf, NaN, ±min-normal. Printed values, no ULP |
| `defects` | device returned inf or zero where the reference is representable. These carry no ULP, so no other field counts them. A `mismatch` against a NaN reference is a domain disagreement, not a defect |
| `verdict` | one of the seven phrases below, precomputed |
| `perf` | `us_median` and `melem_per_s` for one dispatch over 2²⁴ resident elements, with the `host` that took them. `spread_pct` appears only when the row is not trustworthy. Never scored |
| `rationale` | why this variant has these parameters, from `ops/overrides.py` |
| `_runs.{arch}.{dtype}` | tt-metal commit, device, versions. Every claim is per build |

## Outcome labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `exact` | bit-identical to the reference |
| `inexact` | differs, ULP defined |
| `flushed` | reference is subnormal, the dtype cannot hold it |
| `zeroed` | hardware returned 0 for a representable reference. Real, but ULP cannot express it |
| `overflow` | true result exceeds the dtype |
| `undefined` | reference is NaN, outside the mathematical domain |
| `mismatch` | one side finite, the other not. A defect |
| `special` | a special-values row, excluded from every statistic |

## Verdict rules

Computed, never inferred. First match wins.

| Verdict | Rule |
|---|---|
| `N of M points returned inf or zero where a value exists` | defects > 0. Takes precedence, because those points carry no ULP and the figures below exclude them |
| `bit-exact` | max_ulp = 0 |
| `within 2 ULP everywhere` | max_ulp ≤ 2 |
| `accurate to \|x\| <= B; up to M ULP beyond` | unary, usable_to = B defined |
| `never within 2 ULP; mean X, worst M` | unary, no point within 2 ULP |
| `worst pairing M ULP; mean X` | multi-operand, maximum over sampled pairings |
| `no scorable points` | no defined ULP anywhere |

## Answering rules

1. Cite the entry as arch/dtype/op/variant, with its tt-metal commit.
2. Never average across architectures or dtypes. Never extrapolate to an unmeasured cell.
3. A sampled maximum is a lower bound. Binary fp32 and every ternary sweep are sampled, and
   the page says so. `ttnn-accuracy refine` sweeps the cell the sample drew from:
   `fp32/pow` publishes 5,918 ULP and holds 8,300.
4. Never compare a timing across hosts. A timing difference is not a regression.
5. Some wrongness carries no ULP and is in no field here. `ttnn-accuracy check` also requires
   that the answer not change with the tiling, that an in-place op write to its own operand,
   that aliased operands agree with distinct ones, and that an op commute wherever its
   reference does. Only a check run reports these.
6. Not in the index means not measured. Read the reason from the manifest's exclusions and
   refusals, or from [uncovered.md](uncovered.md).
